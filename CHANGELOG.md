## Architecture Evolution

### Current Architecture
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2 with Java 17
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, MongoDB for messages
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions and real-time data
- **Message Queue**: Kafka for event distribution
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for message indexing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections with JWT authentication

### Key Technical Decisions
- Single-service deployment model for simplified operations
- Microservice-ready architecture for future scaling
- Event-driven messaging with Kafka for reliability
- JWT authentication for stateless security
- React Portal pattern for complex UI positioning
- Automatic environment detection for seamless development

## Deployment Options

### Supported Platforms

- **Docker**: Self-hosted with Docker Compose
- **Production**: Scalable cloud deployment configurations

### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + MongoDB hybrid storage
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization  
- **CDN**: Static asset optimization
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and logging
- **Security**: HTTPS/WSS, CORS, JWT validation
