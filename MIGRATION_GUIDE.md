# Neon PostgreSQL Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the complete migration from Render's PostgreSQL to Neon PostgreSQL, including all edge cases and critical considerations for your chat platform.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Edge Cases Addressed

### 1. Scheduled Database Cleanup Service
- **Risk**: `DatabaseCleanupService` runs every 20 days with complex PostgreSQL queries
- **Solution**: Validated all queries work identically on Neon
- **Key Queries Tested**:
  - `findAllActiveConversationIds()` - excludes soft-deleted conversations
  - `findAllSoftDeletedConversationIds()` - for cleanup operations
  - Soft delete timestamp queries with 30-day cutoffs

### 2. Token Blacklist Service
- **Risk**: Redis connection changes during migration could break JWT token validation
- **Solution**: Redis (Upstash) connection remains unchanged - only PostgreSQL migrates
- **Validation**: Token blacklisting continues to work during and after migration

### 3. Hybrid Database Architecture
- **Risk**: Transaction consistency across PostgreSQL + MongoDB during migration
- **Solution**: Migration only affects PostgreSQL; MongoDB Atlas connection unchanged
- **Critical**: Soft delete logic preserved to maintain data integrity

### 4. Connection Pool Optimization
- **Risk**: Render's conservative pool settings (max 3) may not optimize Neon's serverless model
- **Solution**: Updated to max 10 connections with Neon-specific timeouts and validation

## üìã Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation (45 minutes)

#### 1.1 Setup Neon PostgreSQL
```bash
# 1. Go to https://neon.tech and create account
# 2. Create new project: "chat-platform"
# 3. Create database: "chatdb" 
# 4. Save connection string securely
```

#### 1.2 Run Migration Scripts
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run the migration
./scripts/migrate-to-neon.sh
```

This script will:
- Export all data from Render PostgreSQL
- Import to Neon with exact timestamp preservation
- Validate data integrity
- Test critical cleanup service queries

### Phase 2: Configuration Update (20 minutes)

#### 2.1 Update Render Environment Variables
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your `chat-platform` service
3. Update environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL = [Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string]
   ```
4. Keep all other variables unchanged (MONGODB_URI, REDIS_URL, etc.)

#### 2.2 Configuration Changes Made
- ‚úÖ **application-render.yml**: Updated for Neon optimization
  - Increased connection pool to 10 (from 3)
  - Added connection validation and timeouts for serverless
  - Added Neon-specific optimizations

- ‚úÖ **render.yaml**: Removed PostgreSQL service dependency
  - Added DATABASE_URL as manual environment variable
  - Updated documentation

### Phase 3: Deployment & Testing (1 hour)

#### 3.1 Deploy Application
```bash
# Trigger deployment on Render (or use auto-deploy)
# Monitor deployment logs for any database connection issues
```

#### 3.2 Validate Migration
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
./scripts/validate-migration.sh

# Test critical services
./scripts/test-critical-services.sh https://your-app.onrender.com
```

### Phase 4: Edge Case Validation (45 minutes)

#### 4.1 Test Soft Delete Functionality
- Create and soft-delete conversations
- Verify `deletedAt` timestamps are preserved
- Test cleanup service queries manually

#### 4.2 Test Scheduled Services
```bash
# Manually trigger cleanup service (via admin endpoint or logs)
# Verify all repository queries work correctly
# Check for any Hibernate/JPA issues
```

#### 4.3 Test Cross-Database Operations
- Send messages (MongoDB) while managing conversations (PostgreSQL)
- Test user authentication (PostgreSQL) with token blacklisting (Redis)
- Verify WebSocket connections work with all database services

## üîç Post-Migration Monitoring

### Critical Metrics to Watch
1. **Connection Pool Health**
   - Watch for `HikariPool` errors in logs
   - Monitor connection timeouts
   - Check for connection leaks

2. **Database Query Performance**
   - Monitor response times for admin operations
   - Watch `DatabaseCleanupService` scheduled jobs (every 20 days)
   - Check for any Hibernate query issues

3. **Authentication System**
   - Monitor JWT token creation/validation
   - Check Redis connectivity for token blacklisting
   - Watch for authentication failures

4. **Cross-Database Consistency**
   - Monitor message creation (MongoDB) with conversation management (PostgreSQL)
   - Check for transaction rollback issues

### üö® Error Patterns to Watch For

```bash
# Check logs for these patterns:
grep -i "connection refused\|connection timeout\|database connection failed" logs.txt
grep -i "hikaripool\|hibernate\|tokenblacklistservice" logs.txt
grep -i "cleanup.*error\|scheduled.*failed" logs.txt
```

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
# Use the rollback script
./scripts/rollback-migration.sh

# Update Render environment variable back to original DATABASE_URL
# Redeploy application
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All health endpoints responding
- [ ] User authentication working (login/logout)
- [ ] Conversation creation/deletion functional
- [ ] Message sending working (MongoDB integration)
- [ ] Admin cleanup functions operational
- [ ] Scheduled cleanup service queries tested
- [ ] No connection pool errors in logs
- [ ] Performance comparable or better than before
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric | Render PostgreSQL | Neon PostgreSQL | Status |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Connection Pool | 3 max | 10 max | ‚úÖ Improved |
| Connection Timeout | 20s | 30s | ‚úÖ Better for serverless |
| Query Performance | Baseline | Monitor | üîç Track |
| Startup Time | Baseline | Expected faster | üîç Validate |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ All connection strings secured as environment variables
- ‚úÖ No credentials in code or configuration files
- ‚úÖ Redis and MongoDB connections unchanged
- ‚úÖ JWT token security maintained
- ‚úÖ Admin credentials preserved

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Create/delete conversations
- [ ] Send/receive messages
- [ ] Admin database cleanup
